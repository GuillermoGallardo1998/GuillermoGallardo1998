👀 Interested in natural science, IoT and programming, recently obtained React certifications from Meta.
🌱 Currently learning NextJS, Tailwind and some UX/UI principles.
💞️ Looking to collaborate on interesting real-life application projects, especially those related with IoT, sports or finance.
📫 How to reach me: Right here. Just send a DM and we can get in touch.
