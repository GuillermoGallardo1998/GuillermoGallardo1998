## About me
Full stack web developer and engineer with a holistic approach to building functional, well-crafted digital solutions. I focus on modern application development, blending logic, design, and user experience. My background in client relations, logistics, and leadership helps me understand real-world needs and turn them into useful tools. Always learning, always building.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating an IoT platform for setting up and managing your own IoT implementations.
- 👀 Interested in natural science, IoT and programming, recently obtained React certifications from Meta.
- 🌱 Currently learning NextJS, Tailwind and some UX/UI principles.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on interesting real-life application projects, especially those related with IoT, sports or finance.
- 📫 How to reach me: Right here. Just send a DM and we can get in touch.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a mechanical engineer, which led me to embedding, which in turn led me to web development.
